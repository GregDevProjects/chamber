---TODO------------------------------------------------
- game over screen
- cursor become crosshair
- patterns for blocks
- overload mode
    - harder to control
    - invulnerable 
    - bouncy
    - kill stuff on contact

    RIGHT NOW, TO FINISH LEVEL 1
    - refactor
    - move back spawn location for blocks

    - gauge shows time left 
    - pickup gun
    - blocks get more intense 

    LEVEL 2
    - running from spinner 
    - learn kick 

    Level 3
    - teleport movement?

-spinners
    - brief invulnerable after getting hit so it can't be killed instantly
    - something happens when it collides with a block
        - kills the block if in death state
        - if not? ...

-blocks
    - grid flow on sin wave
    - how does it react to kick?

- life/power gauge
    - 

spinning 
    - keep spinning to combo 
    - get extra spin on sucessful kick

- implement gravity 
- implement side lasers

---Gameplay------------------------------------------------
Shooting 
 - should it kill all blocks?

Gravity

Block Rotation?

---Levels------------------------------------------------

1
- show the basics of movement
- protect your head
- shoot to move
    - blocks that explode

2
- gravity 

Tunnel level

---IDEAS-----------------------------------------------

trampoline block for gravity levels

tryout different directions/ speedup conditions 
 - blocks can change directions at random

Give blocks a consistent mass? 

give the blocks different properties 
    - explode 
    - bouncy
        - force player bounce on contact?

---BUGS-----------------------------------------------
- world walls only bounce player in one direction






--TEXT DIALOGUE-----------------------------------------------
thoughts:
    - animated bubble depending on emotion 
    - different colors 

bounce physics improvements 
    - create a new object a few pixels away
    - give it a angle/position that mimics the parent 
    - fling it at the collided object at the same position
