---TODO------------------------------------------------
- game over screen
- robot text should be an oval, not a circle
- bounce blocks away on hit with torso
- add some friction to the rotation 
- cursor become crosshair
- patterns for blocks

    RIGHT NOW
    - player bounces when hitting a wall?
    - refactor
    - an effect when player collides with block

- implement gravity 
- implement side lasers

---Gameplay------------------------------------------------
Shooting 
 - should it kill all blocks?

Gravity

Block Rotation?

---Levels------------------------------------------------

1
- show the basics of movement
- protect your head
- shoot to move

2
- gravity 

Tunnel level

---IDEAS-----------------------------------------------

trampoline block for gravity levels

tryout different directions/ speedup conditions 
 - blocks can change directions at random

Give blocks a consistent mass? 

give the blocks different properties 
    - explode 
    - bouncy
        - force player bounce on contact?

---BUGS-----------------------------------------------
- apply some rotational drag
- block overlaps gun






--TEXT DIALOGUE-----------------------------------------------
what it needs to do:
    - system for advancing dialogue

thoughts:
    - animated bubble depending on emotion 
    - different colors
