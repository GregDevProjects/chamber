---TODO------------------------------------------------
- game over screen
- robot text should be an oval, not a circle
- add some friction to the rotation 
- cursor become crosshair
- patterns for blocks
- overload mode
    - harder to control
    - invulnerable 
    - bouncy
    - kill stuff on contact

    RIGHT NOW, TO FINISH LEVEL 1
    - refactor
    - death animations 
    - pickup gun
    - blocks get more intense 

    LEVEL 2
    - running from spinner 
    - learn kick 

-spinners
    - brief invulnerable after getting hit so it can't be killed instantly
    - something happens when it collides with a block
        - kills the block if in death state
        - if not? ...

-blocks
    - grid flow on sin wave
    - how does it react to kick?

- life/power gauge
    - 


- implement gravity 
- implement side lasers

---Gameplay------------------------------------------------
Shooting 
 - should it kill all blocks?

Gravity

Block Rotation?

---Levels------------------------------------------------

1
- show the basics of movement
- protect your head
- shoot to move

2
- gravity 

Tunnel level

---IDEAS-----------------------------------------------

trampoline block for gravity levels

tryout different directions/ speedup conditions 
 - blocks can change directions at random

Give blocks a consistent mass? 

give the blocks different properties 
    - explode 
    - bouncy
        - force player bounce on contact?

---BUGS-----------------------------------------------
- apply some rotational drag
- block overlaps gun






--TEXT DIALOGUE-----------------------------------------------
what it needs to do:
    - system for advancing dialogue

thoughts:
    - animated bubble depending on emotion 
    - different colors
