---TODO------------------------------------------------
!! the text needs to be able to bleed out of the game area !!
- make a level
- implement gravity 
- implement side lasers
- make an enemy

---Gameplay------------------------------------------------
Shooting 
 - should it kill all blocks?

Gravity

Block Rotation?

---Levels------------------------------------------------

1
- show the basics of movement
- protect your head
- shoot to move

2
- gravity 

Tunnel level

---IDEAS-----------------------------------------------

trampoline block for gravity levels

tryout different directions/ speedup conditions 
 - blocks can change directions at random

Give blocks a consistent mass? 

give the blocks different properties 
    - explode 
    - bouncy
        - force player bounce on contact?

---BUGS-----------------------------------------------
- gun doesn't aim when mouse is moved on the purple border
- player's center of rotation doesn't include his head







--TEXT DIALOGUE-----------------------------------------------
what it needs to do:
    - wrap words
    - continue when a button is pressed 
    - spell out dynamically
    - float next to the character

thoughts:
    - animated bubble depending on emotion 
    - different colors
